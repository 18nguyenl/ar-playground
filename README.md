# I was playing with Unity's AR Foundation
Honestly, this project is dry and dead, but I've decided to keep it because it contains my memories and experiences.

For example, my friend, Zach, suggested I learn Unity AR Foundating to make interesting AR apps.

I tried to do this, and I remember sharing this on Twitter at the gym, a stage of my life where I was really trying to move forwards somewhere.

I archive this to document my journey in code.
